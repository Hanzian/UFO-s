# UFO-s Analysis

## Overview of the Analysis:

This analysis is a webpage that allows users to search and filter UFO sightings by date, city, and state. The purpose of the analysis is to provide a platform for users to explore and analyze UFO sighting data in order to better understand the ubiquity and potential causes of these sightings.

## Results:

### Welcome to UFO Sightings!

To perform a search, users can enter a date, city, and state in the designated input fields and click the "Filter Table" button. The table will then display the results of the search, including the date, city, state, shape, and duration of the UFO sightings that match the search criteria. Users can also sort the table by clicking on the column headers.

In addition to the search functionality, the webpage includes an explanatory text that provides context and background information on UFO sightings and the role of citizen-scientists in cataloguing these sightings.

## Summary:

One drawback of this webpage is that it does not include a visual representation of the UFO sighting data, such as a chart or map. This could make it more difficult for users to quickly understand patterns or trends in the data.

Two recommendations for further development of this webpage could include adding a chart or map to visualize the UFO sighting data, and implementing a feature to allow users to report their own UFO sightings and contribute to the dataset. This would make the analysis more interactive and engaging for users, and could help to expand the dataset for further analysis.
